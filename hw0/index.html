<h4>CSCI-E28 Self-Assessment Exercises</h4>

This page of Unix and C questions includes a minimum set of skills
you need for the course.  If you cannot do or figure out answers to
these quickly, you should not be taking the course.  On the other hand,
being able to do these does not ensure you are qualified.
