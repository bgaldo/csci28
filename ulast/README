Files:
ulast.c - main program file
utmplib.c - toolkit for buffered reads
utmplib.h - header for utmplib
Makefile  - type make to make the files
README    - this file
typescript - proof of test/compilation
Plan       - a plan
multi-utmp.h - hypothetical header file for part IV

NOTES:
The default UTMP File in ulast is /var/run/utmp, while the default
last file is /var/log/wtmp. 

Last does not include the "215" suffix of Bruce's username in the output.
Ulast does include this, which I consider to be a feature--not a bug.
