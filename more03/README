README for more03

  Student: Ben Galdo
  Date: 02/02/2025

Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    more03.c    -- my solution to the project
    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

Notes:

  Bugs:
    - A partial last page of a file is not displayed, as the next file prints
      a full first page at EOF. (resolved)
    - A '?' is printed at EOF before "More?" (resolved)
    - Entering 'q' when there are additional files doesn't exit program (fixed)
    - Running the program with no args/input from stdout breaks 'q' exit (open)
    - Tabs are not handled correctly (open)
    - Running more03 on a dynamic file like 'top' breaks things. Running more 
      broke things worse though. (open)
    - Sometimes more03 does not adjust to a resized window until the second 
      line/page is printed. More has similar behavior. (open)
